## 2. Business Problem

As Jenson USA scales operations, it faces several challenges:
- Limited visibility into **top-selling vs. underperforming products**.
- Overstock or stockouts due to **inadequate inventory forecasting**.
- Difficulty in tracking **sales by category, region, or channel**.
- No centralized view of **customer segmentation** and purchasing behavior.

Without proper insights, decision-makers risk misallocating inventory, missing sales targets, and losing customers to competitors.
